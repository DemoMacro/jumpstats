## Welcome to JumpStats

Thank you for choosing JumpStats. These terms of service govern your use of our URL shortening platform, which allows you to create short, memorable links with comprehensive analytics and custom domain support. By accessing or using JumpStats, you agree to be bound by these terms.

## Service Description

JumpStats provides a URL shortening service that transforms long web addresses into concise, shareable links. Our platform includes features for tracking click analytics, understanding audience demographics, managing links through an intuitive dashboard, and using custom domains when available in your plan. The service is built on modern web technologies including data storage, analytics databases, and caching services for performance.

## Account Creation and Security

### Registration Requirements

To use certain features of JumpStats, you must create an account and provide accurate, complete information. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account credentials. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.

### Account Security

You are solely responsible for all activities that occur under your account, whether or not you authorized those activities. We recommend using a strong, unique password and enabling any available security features. If we suspect that your account has been compromised, we may temporarily suspend your account for security purposes and attempt to notify you.

### Session Management

Our platform includes session management features that allow you to view and revoke active sessions. Administrators have the ability to revoke user sessions for security reasons. Multiple concurrent sessions are supported, allowing you to stay logged in across multiple devices.

## Acceptable Use Policy

### Permitted Use

You agree to use JumpStats only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these terms. You may create links to legitimate content that you own or have the right to share. Our service is designed for personal and business use cases including social media sharing, marketing campaigns, and audience analytics.

### Prohibited Activities

You must not use JumpStats to create links that redirect to illegal content, malware, phishing sites, or any material that violates applicable laws or regulations. The service cannot be used for spam, fraud, or deceptive practices. Creating links that violate the rights of others, including intellectual property rights, is prohibited.

We reserve the right to remove any link that we believe violates these terms or is otherwise objectionable, without prior notice. We may also suspend or terminate accounts that repeatedly or seriously violate acceptable use policies.

### Content Responsibility

You retain ownership of the links you create. However, you are solely responsible for ensuring that your links and the content they point to comply with these terms and all applicable laws. We do not pre-screen or monitor the content of linked websites, and we cannot guarantee the safety or legitimacy of third-party content.

## Data and Analytics

### Data Collection

When visitors click your short links, we collect analytics data including IP addresses (anonymized for privacy), geographic location, device type, browser information, referrer data, and timestamps. This data is stored in a specialized analytics database and presented in your dashboard to help you understand your audience.

### Bot Detection

Our system automatically detects and marks bot traffic. This helps you distinguish between human and automated traffic in your analytics.

### Data Accuracy

While we strive for accurate analytics and geographic data, we cannot guarantee complete accuracy due to technical limitations, VPN usage, ad blockers, and other factors. Geographic location is determined through third-party services and represents the approximate location of the IP address, not necessarily the physical location of the user.

### Query Parameters

We capture and analyze UTM parameters and custom query parameters from your original URLs. This allows for detailed campaign tracking and marketing analytics. The complete query parameter map is stored in the analytics database for flexible querying.

## Organization Features

### Organization Management

JumpStats supports organization features that allow groups of users to collaborate on link management. Organizations can have multiple members with different roles including owner, administrator, and regular member. Role-based permissions determine what actions each member can perform within the organization.

### Organization Responsibilities

Organization owners and administrators are responsible for managing organization members and resources. When an organization is deleted, all associated data including links and analytics is permanently removed. Members can be removed from organizations by owners and administrators.

## Custom Domains

### Domain Verification

If your plan includes custom domain support, you can add your own domain names for short links. Before a custom domain can be used, it must be verified through a DNS TXT record process to prove ownership. Only verified domains in active status can be used for creating links.

### Domain Responsibilities

You are responsible for ensuring that your custom domains comply with these terms and all applicable laws. We reserve the right to suspend or remove domains that violate our policies or are used for abusive purposes. DNS configuration changes are your responsibility, including adding and maintaining verification records.

## Service Availability and Performance

### Uptime Commitment

We strive to maintain high availability and fast redirect speeds for all short links. Our caching system helps ensure quick responses. However, we cannot guarantee 100% uptime or uninterrupted service.

### Scheduled Maintenance

We may perform scheduled maintenance that temporarily affects service availability. We will attempt to provide advance notice when possible, but emergency maintenance may be necessary without prior notice.

### Service Limitations

During high traffic periods or technical issues, redirect speeds may be slower than normal. Our analytics processing is asynchronous and runs in the background, which means very recent clicks may not immediately appear in your dashboard.

## Intellectual Property

### Service Ownership

JumpStats, including all software, databases, trademarks, and content, is owned by us or our licensors and is protected by intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, or create derivative works of our service without explicit permission.

### Your Content

You retain ownership of the links you create and any content you provide to us. By using our service, you grant us a license to store, process, and display your data as necessary to provide the service. We do not acquire any ownership rights to your links or the content they point to.

## Account Termination and Suspension

### Termination by You

You may delete your account at any time through your account settings. Account deletion permanently removes all your data including links, analytics, and organization memberships. This action is irreversible.

### Termination by Us

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if you violate these terms, engage in fraudulent activity, abuse the service, or for any other reason at our sole discretion. We will attempt to provide notice and explanation when possible, except in cases involving immediate threats to security or legality.

### Effect of Termination

Upon account termination, your right to use the service ceases immediately. We may permanently delete your data, though we may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes. Organization owners should ensure proper transition of resources before deleting their accounts.

## Limitation of Liability

### Service Provision

JumpStats is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. We do not guarantee that the service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free.

### Damages Exclusion

To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to lost profits, data loss, or business interruption arising from your use of or inability to use the service.

### Link and Content Liability

We are not responsible for the content of websites that your short links redirect to, nor do we endorse or guarantee the accuracy, safety, or legality of third-party content. Your use of third-party websites is at your own risk and subject to their terms of service and privacy policies.

### Analytics Accuracy

While we strive for accurate analytics, we cannot guarantee complete precision due to technical factors beyond our control including IP geolocation limitations, bot detection accuracy, and network issues.

## Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless JumpStats, its owners, operators, and affiliates from any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including legal fees) arising from your use of the service, your violation of these terms, or your violation of any third-party rights.

## Modifications to Terms and Service

### Term Changes

We may update these terms of service from time to time to reflect changes in our service, business practices, or legal requirements. When we make changes, we will update the effective date and notify you through the service or by email if you have opted in to receive notifications.

### Service Changes

We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the service at any time. We may also introduce new features, fee structures, or usage limits. Significant changes will be communicated to users in advance when possible.

### Continued Use

Your continued use of the service after changes to these terms constitutes acceptance of the updated terms. If you do not agree to the changes, you must discontinue use of the service and delete your account.

## Dispute Resolution

### Governing Law

These terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where JumpStats is operated. Any disputes arising from these terms or your use of the service will be resolved in accordance with applicable law.

### Arbitration

To the extent permitted by law, any disputes between you and JumpStats will be resolved through binding arbitration rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.

## General Provisions

### Entire Agreement

These terms constitute the entire agreement between you and JumpStats regarding your use of the service, superseding any prior agreements or communications.

### Severability

If any provision of these terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.

### Waiver

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these terms does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
