## Our Commitment

At JumpStats, we take your privacy seriously and are committed to protecting your personal information. This policy explains how we collect, use, store, and safeguard your data when you use our URL shortening service.

## Information We Collect

### Account Information

When you create an account with us, we collect your email address, name, and username. Your password is securely hashed using industry-standard encryption before storage, which means we cannot see or access your actual password. All authentication is handled through Better Auth, a secure authentication system that manages user sessions and account security.

### Link Data

For every short link you create, we store the original URL, a unique short code, link title, description, creation date, and modification date. You may also optionally set an expiration date for your links. Links can be associated with your personal account or with organizations you belong to. Custom domain support is available for verified domains.

### Analytics and Click Data

When someone clicks on your short link, we collect detailed analytics to help you understand your audience. This includes the visitor's IP address, which we automatically anonymize through technical means to protect individual privacy. We use the IP address to determine approximate geographic location including country, region, and city through third-party services.

We also collect technical information about the device and browser used, including device type (mobile, desktop, or tablet), browser name and version, operating system, and device vendor. This helps you understand how your audience accesses your content. Our system automatically detects bot traffic, marking these visits separately in your analytics.

Additionally, we capture the timestamp of each click, the referring website when available, and any UTM parameters or custom query parameters present in your original URL. This data is stored in a specialized analytics database.

### Organization and Domain Data

If you use our organization features, we store organization membership information including your role within the organization. For custom domains, we store domain names, verification tokens, verification status, and verification timestamps.

## How We Use Your Data

### Providing Core Service

Your data enables us to create and manage short links, redirect visitors to your intended destination URLs, and display comprehensive analytics in your dashboard. The link caching system uses caching services to improve performance, with automatic expiration based on your link's expiration date or a preset timeout.

### Improving Service Quality

We analyze usage patterns and aggregate analytics to identify bugs, understand feature adoption, and develop new capabilities. Click events are processed asynchronously in the background to ensure fast redirects without impacting user experience.

### Communication

We use your email address to send important account notifications, security alerts, and responses to your inquiries. With your permission, we may also send service updates and promotional communications, which you can opt out of at any time.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

### Never Selling Your Information

We never sell, rent, or monetize your personal information in any way.

### Service Providers

We work with trusted third-party services to operate our platform. Your data may be processed by our hosting infrastructure, database providers, and caching services. These providers have strict data protection obligations and may only use your data to deliver the services we've engaged them for.

### Legal Requirements

We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid legal requests from law enforcement authorities. We will notify you when legally permitted unless doing so would compromise a criminal investigation or jeopardize national security.

### Custom Domains

When you use custom domains, DNS resolution occurs through public DNS servers. The verification process requires adding a TXT record to your domain's DNS configuration, which is publicly visible but contains only a verification token.

## Data Security

### Encryption and Protection

All data transmitted between your browser and our servers is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS. Passwords are hashed using industry-standard algorithms before storage. We employ secure session management, with session tokens that can be revoked at any time by administrators or through account deletion.

### Access Controls

Our platform implements role-based access control. Global administrators have full system access. Organization owners and administrators can manage organization resources and members. Regular users can only access their own links and organization resources where they have membership. These permissions are enforced at the API level for every request.

### Infrastructure Security

We maintain security through regular updates, vulnerability scanning, and following best practices for web application security. Our database migrations are versioned and repeatable, ensuring schema changes are applied safely.

## Your Rights and Controls

### Access and Portability

You can view all data associated with your account through the dashboard, including your links, analytics data, and organization memberships. Administrators can view and manage all users and sessions through the admin interface.

### Deletion and Removal

When you delete your account, all associated data including links, analytics, and organization memberships is permanently removed from the database. The deletion process is immediate and irreversible. For organizations, owners and administrators can remove members, and administrators can delete entire organizations which removes all associated data.

### Correction and Updates

You can update your account information, email preferences, and password settings at any time through your account settings. Organization administrators can update organization details and member roles.

### Session Management

You can view and revoke your active sessions through the account settings. Administrators can revoke any user's sessions for security purposes.

## Cookies and Local Storage

We use browser cookies and local storage to maintain your authentication session, remember your preferences, and provide a seamless user experience. Disabling cookies in your browser will prevent you from staying logged in and may affect certain features. Our authentication system uses both session cookies for immediate authentication and persistent storage for convenience.

## Data Retention

### Active Accounts and Links

For active accounts, your data remains stored indefinitely until you choose to delete it. Links remain active unless you explicitly delete them or set an expiration date. Links with expiration dates are automatically marked as expired when the expiration time passes and will no longer redirect visitors.

### Deleted Data

When you delete your account or individual links, the data is immediately removed from our database and cache. Analytics data is optimized for efficient querying. While we don't automatically purge analytics data, we may implement retention policies in the future.

### Cached Data

Links are cached using caching services with automatic expiration. The cache timeout is based on the remaining time until your link expires or a preset duration. When links are deleted or updated, the cache is immediately invalidated.

### Inactive Accounts

We reserve the right to remove data from accounts that have been inactive for extended periods, but we will attempt to notify you before taking such action.

## Third-Party Links and Content

Your short links redirect to websites and content that we do not control. We are not responsible for the privacy practices, terms of service, or content of third-party websites. Once a visitor clicks your short link, they are subject to the privacy policy of the destination website. We encourage you to review the privacy practices of any websites you link to.

## Children's Privacy

JumpStats is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we discover that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will delete it promptly. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.

## International Data Transfers

Your information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your country of residence. Our service providers and databases may be located in various jurisdictions. We take appropriate safeguards to ensure your data remains protected in accordance with this privacy policy.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technology, legal requirements, or other factors. When we make significant changes, we will notify you through the service or by email if you have opted in to receive such notifications. Your continued use of the service after the effective date indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.
